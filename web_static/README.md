# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Overview

This project focuses on building the front end of an AirBnB clone step by step. It involves creating simple HTML static pages, setting up style guides, using fake content, and developing a user interface without JavaScript or data loaded from external sources. The project aims to improve your understanding of HTML and CSS, two fundamental technologies for web development.

## Project Layout

The project is organized into several tasks, each building on the previous one. Here's an overview of the tasks:

1. **Inline Styling**: Write an HTML page that displays a header and a footer using inline styling. The header should be red (#FF0000), and the footer green (#00FF00).

2. **Head Styling**: Similar to Task 1, but the styling is now done in the head tag using the style tag.

3. **CSS Files**: Continue from Task 2, but this time, use separate CSS files for styling. This project includes global styles, header styles, and footer styles.

4. **Zoning Done!**: Add locations and amenities filters with contextual dropdowns. This task builds on the previous tasks and introduces a filtering feature.

5. **More Filters**: Expand the locations and amenities filters and add more styling.

6. **It's (h)over**: Add dropdown functionality to the filters and make them appear when the mouse is over the filter div.

7. **Display Results**: Add a "Places" section with listings and styling. This task introduces content to the page.

8. **More Details**: Enhance the Place articles with more information, including price, details about the place, owner information, and descriptions.
